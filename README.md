# Room Assigment Zuri Task

## This assignment would encompass almost all we've learned so far:



- In continuation of the RecyclerView Contact app you did last week "A Better Way", design two screens for signup and login respectively.
- So if someone say Feona wants to access the list of contacts in the app, she has to first signup and sign in before she is given access.
- She sign's up, you store her data in the app using Room database and the app directs her to the login screen where she inputs her data and if correct she is directed to the RecyclerView of contacts.

### NOTE:

- The launcher activity in the manifest file should be the activity for signup.
- The data needed for sign up and sign in should be at least "email and password".
- The activity for sign in should check if the entered email and password exists in the Room database.
- Intents should be used to move from one activity to the other.
